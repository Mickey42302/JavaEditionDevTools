# JavaEditionDevTools
In Java Edition, there are a bunch of development tools that are locked away by default. This mod re-enables them, allowing you to get a look at what Mojang uses to develop the game!

Both versions grant access to the following commands:

• /chase

• /debugmobspawning

• /debugpath

• /raid

• /spawn_armor_trims (Warning: This command can cause a lot of lag!)

• /serverpack

• /warden_spawn_tracker

The following commands are only available on multiplayer:

• /debugconfig (Warning: This command will softlock the game if it is not used properly!)

For this mod to work properly, you must install the correct version on your client/server. The "devtools-patch-client.jar" file should be installed to your client. The "devtools-patch-server.jar" file should be installed on your server.

Note: At present, only the development commands are available. I will make the other debugging features available in a later update.
